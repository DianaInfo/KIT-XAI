	\section{General}
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Why do we need XAI?
		\asw{\newline It helps to understand and debug the behavior of learned models. also it answers the question WHY a model behaves the way it does.}
		\item What parts define a dataset?
		\asw{\newline inputs, features, targets, datapoints}
		\item What are the 2 classes of interpretability?
		\asw{\newline intrinsic interpretability \& post-hoc interpretability (mixture also possible)}
		\item E: How does model complexity influence interpretability?
		\asw{\newline With growing model complexity the interpretability of models decreases. This often is due to the many factors that are included in models with higher complexity.}
	\end{itemize}
	\newpage

	\section{Intrinsic Interpretability}
	
	\begin{itemize}
	\item What are the methods for intrinsic interpretability?
	\asw{\newline Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Generalized Linear Model (GLM) \& Generalized Additive Model (GAM)}
	
	\item What is \textbf{\underline{Linear Regression}}?
	\asw{\newline Linear Regression wants to predict a continuous value with a linear combination of features.
	\newline $y = x^T \beta + \epsilon$}
	\item What does the $\epsilon$ in the Linear Regression equation express?
	\asw{\newline It expresses the uncertainty / noise on $y$.}
	\item What are methods to calculate Linear Regression?
	\asw{\newline It can be calculated by OLS (Ordinary Least Squares) and TLS (Total Least Squares).
	\newline OLS: $\hat{\beta} = argmin_\beta ||y - X \beta||^2_2$, $\hat{\beta} = (X^T X^{-1})^{-1} X^T y$
	\newline TLS: includes uncertainty in features}
	\item What is the interpretation of Linear Regression?
	\asw{\newline Changing a single feature $x_m$ by $\Delta x_m$ will directly effect outcome $y$ by $\beta_m \Delta x_m$
		\newline Assumption: no interaction between features}
	\item What is the $R^2$ value and how is it defined?
	\asw{\newline $R^2$ expresses how well the model explains the data
		\newline Definition: $R^2 = 1 - \frac{SSE}{SST} = 1 - \frac{\sum_{i} (y_i - \hat{y}_i)^2}{\sum_i (y_i - \overline{y}_i)^2}$}
	\item E: How can the thresholds for the $R^2$ metric for a regression model be interpreted?
	\asw{\newline $R^2 \rightarrow 1$: model fits data very well
		\newline $R^2 \rightarrow 0$: model does not fit data at all
		\newline $R^2 < 0$: model learned opposite (worse than data mean)}
	\item How can the t-statistic be used for interpretation of a NN?
	\asw{\newline It can be used for each feature to interpret its performance.}
	\item What are the assumptions regarding a NN interpretation for Linear Regression?
	\asw{\newline Linearity (prediction linear in features),
		\newline Normality (data is normally distributed),
		\newline Homoscedasticity (error of prediction has const. variance),
		\newline Independence (of datapoints),
		\newline Fixed Features (no measurment error in features),
		\newline Absence of multicollinearity}
	\item What are types of Regularization?
	\asw{\newline Ridge Regression: $\hat{\beta} = argmin_\beta[||y - X\beta||^2_2 + \lambda ||\beta||^2_2]$ (L2-norm)
		\newline $\rightarrow$ having many features $\rightarrow$ higher chance for strong correlation
		\newline LASSO Regression: $\hat{\beta} = argmin_\beta[||y - X\beta||^2_2 + \lambda ||\beta||_1]$ (L1-norm)
		\newline $\rightarrow$ \underline{L}east \underline{A}bsolute \underline{S}hrinkage and \underline{S}election \underline{O}perator, encourages sparsity in features}
	\item Why do we need Regularization?
	\asw{\newline It is needed to make sure that only the most important features are used to determine the results. It helps keeping the weights as small as possible. It reduces the complexity of the model, so that it only generally fits the data and not overfits to the data.}
	\item What are advantages/ diadvantages of Linear Regression?
	\asw{\newline \textcolor{green}{$+$} Easy to understand
		\newline \textcolor{green}{$+$} Widely applied / well understood
		\newline \textcolor{green}{$+$} Easy to assess individual feature contribution
		\newline \textcolor{green}{$+$} Guaranteed to find optimal solution (w.r.t. given data)
		\newline \textcolor{red}{$-$} Can only model linear relationships between features \& output
		\newline \textcolor{red}{$-$} Limited predictive performance
		\newline \textcolor{red}{$-$} Weights can be unintuitive}
	\newline
	\hrule 
	
	\item What are \textbf{\underline{Generalized Linear Models}}?

		\newline \textcolor{red}{$-$} No automatic feature interaction
		\newline \textcolor{red}{$-$} Complete separation if one feature perfectly separates the classes $\rightarrow$ it would theoretically get infinite weight
		\newline \tab $\rightarrow$ makes fitting of model impossible, paradox: a single great feature makes model unusable}
	\item What is the Perceptron?
	\asw{\newline Perceptron is a simple calculation-unit that applies logistic regression.}
	\item What is the formula to calculate the Perceptron?
	\asw{\newline $\mu = \frac{1}{1+ exp(-x^T \beta)}$, $y = a(x^T \beta)$}
	\item Why do we need an activation function?
	\asw{\newline The activation function makes it possible to work with non-linear data. Also it can output probabilities for classification.}
	\item What kinds of activation functions exist?
	\asw{\newline Sigmoid: $a(z) = \frac{1}{1+ exp(-z)}$, ReLU: $a(z) = max(0,z)$
		\newline classical perceptrons $\rightarrow$ heavyside step function: $a(z) = 0_{[z\geq0]}, 1_{[z<0]}$}
	\item E: Given a logistic regression model with trained weights $\beta$, how does the output $y$ change, if we change a single input feature $x'_m$ by one unit, i.e., $x'_m = x_m + 1$?
	\asw{\newline $y' = y \times exp(\beta_m)$
		\newline A change of $x_m$ by 1 unit changes the ratio by a factor of $exp(\beta_m)$}
	\newline
	\hrule 
	
	\item What are \textbf{\underline{Generalized Additive Models}}?
	\asw{\newline They consist of smooth functions per feature that are summed up and build the link function.}
	\item What is the difference between GLMs and GAMs?
	\asw{\newline The simple weight coefficients of GLMs are replaced with functions for each features in GAMs.}
	\item How is the link function for GAMs defined? \qst{Does the link function need to be a smooth function?}
	\asw{\newline The link function has to be a smooth function, but does not have to be specified precisely.}
	\item Does the link function have to be specified precisely?
	\asw{\newline It does not have to be specified precisely.}
	\item What happens if prediction is conditioned on only one single feature $x_k$?
	\asw{\newline In this case the conditioned feature is fixed and the expectation is only calculated on all other features.}
	\item What is Backfitting?
	\asw{\newline Backfitting always calculates $y$ with the feature functions as they are and then adjusts one the feature functions one after each other until it converges and the feature functions don't change anymore.}
	\item Can the Least Squares method still be used with GAMs?
	\asw{\newline Yes, the Least Squares method can still be used with GAMs.}
	\item E: What are the advantages/ disadvantages of GAMs?
	\asw{\newline \textcolor{green}{$+$} Model complex relationships between features \& prediction
