	\section{General}
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Why do we need XAI?
		\newline It helps to understand and debug the behavior of learned models. also it answers the question WHY a model behaves the way it does.
		\item What parts define a dataset?
		\newline inputs, features, targets, datapoints
		\item What are the 2 classes of interpretability?
		\newline intrinsic interpretability \& post-hoc interpretability (mixture also possible)
	\end{itemize}
