	\begin{itemize}

		\newline It helps to understand and debug the behavior of learned models. also it answers the question WHY a model behaves the way it does.

		\newline inputs, features, targets, datapoints
		\item What are the 2 classes of interpretability?
		\newline intrinsic interpretability \& post-hoc interpretability (mixture also possible)
		\item E: How does model complexity influence interpretability?
		\newline With growing model complexity the interpretability of models decreases. This often is due to the many factors that are included in models with higher complexity.
